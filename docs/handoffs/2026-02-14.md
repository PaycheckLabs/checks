# Checks Handoff - 2026-02-14

Owner: James Odom  
Repo: https://github.com/PaycheckLabs/checks  
Whitepaper (handbook): https://paycheck-labs.gitbook.io/checks-whitepaper  

Phase: Initial testnet beta  
Focus: Payment Checks first (Vesting Checks and Staking Checks deferred)

---

## 0) Canonical references (read first)
- Project anchor: docs/anchor.md
- This handoff: docs/handoffs/2026-02-13.md

---

## 1) Current objective
Start the Payment Checks spec lock step and produce:
1. Locked v1 behavior decisions (no options left open)
2. Final contract interface and events
3. One canonical status model shared by contracts, indexer, SDK, and explorer
4. Test checklist aligned to the locked spec

---

## 2) Repo status snapshot
Monorepo baseline is in place:
- packages/contracts/
- packages/indexer/
- packages/sdk/
- apps/web/
- docs/

Tooling and newline-sensitive files were fixed and verified.

Verification rule:
If anything looks suspicious, click Raw. If Raw shows one long line, fix it immediately.

---

## 3) Decisions confirmed
- Initial testnet scope is Payment Checks only.
- Vesting Checks and Staking Checks are deferred until Payment Checks are stable.

---

## 4) Immediate next steps (ordered)
1. Payment Checks spec lock
2. Update docs/specs/payment-checks.md to locked v1
3. Update packages/contracts/src/IPaymentChecks.sol to match locked interface and events
4. Add a spec lock decision record in docs/decisions/
5. Draft implementation plan and Foundry test outline
6. Only after the data model is locked: start web and explorer wiring

---

## 5) Payment Checks spec lock checklist (do next)
Lock the following decisions with zero ambiguity:
- Recipient model: direct address vs claim model
- Expiration: none vs timestamp and rules
- Cancellation: none vs rules
- Redemption: full-only vs partial
- Token policy for v1 testnet: any ERC-20 vs allowlist vs single token
- Required events and parameters
- Deterministic status mapping used by indexer and explorer
- Test checklist and invariants (including unusual ERC-20 behavior)

---

## 6) Constraints
- Security first
- Tight testnet scope, no feature creep
- No secrets in repo
- Avoid em dashes in docs
- Workflows optimized for GitHub UI edits (not local-first)

---

## 7) Open questions
- Target testnet network
- Upgradeability approach for testnet (none vs minimal proxy)
- Indexing approach for v1 (simple log scan now, more advanced later)

---

## 8) Working agreements
- Specs and decisions in docs/ are the source of truth
- Do not implement contract logic until spec lock is complete
- Keep Payment Checks v1 minimal and safe, then expand

---

## 9) How to start the next chat (copy and paste)
Continue Checks build.

Repo: https://github.com/PaycheckLabs/checks
Whitepaper: https://paycheck-labs.gitbook.io/checks-whitepaper

Read first:
- docs/handoffs/2026-02-13.md
- docs/anchor.md

Goal now: Payment Checks spec lock.
Output: locked v1 spec + final interface and events + next commit plan (contracts, indexer types, sdk types).
Constraints: security first, tight testnet scope, avoid em dashes.

---

## 10) Closeout
Commit message suggestion: docs: finalize handoff 2026-02-13

After committing:
- Open Raw and confirm:
  - This file is multi-line (not one long line)
  - Section "## 10) Closeout" is present at the bottom

Then start a new chat and paste Section 9.
