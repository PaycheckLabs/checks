# Checks Handoff - 2026-02-13

Owner: James Odom  
Repo: https://github.com/PaycheckLabs/checks  
Whitepaper (handbook): https://paycheck-labs.gitbook.io/checks-whitepaper  
Current phase: Initial testnet beta  
Current focus: Payment Checks (Vesting + Staking deferred)

## 0) Read first
- Anchor: docs/anchor.md
- Decision records: docs/decisions/0001-payment-checks-first.md

## 1) Snapshot
We are setting up a PNPM monorepo for Checks with four major modules:
- packages/contracts
- packages/indexer
- packages/sdk
- apps/web (later)

Primary goal: ship a safe, minimal Payment Checks testnet baseline with deterministic status reconstruction.

## 2) Current status
### Working
- Repo created and public
- Base monorepo structure exists (apps/, packages/, docs/)
- Anchor and handoff template exist
- Decision record 0001 exists (Payment Checks first)

### Blocked or needs fix
- Root package.json is invalid JSON (missing comma between scripts and devDependencies)
- .gitignore, .prettierignore, .editorconfig are single-line and will not function correctly

## 3) What changed since last session
- Created/updated baseline repo files and docs
- Added docs/anchor.md and docs/handoff.md
- Added decision record docs/decisions/0001-payment-checks-first.md

## 4) Today’s goal
Prepare the repo so we can start “Payment Checks spec lock” next session.

## 5) Immediate next steps (ordered)
1) Fix root config files (package.json, .gitignore, .prettierignore, .editorconfig) so tooling works
2) Add docs/specs/payment-checks.md (draft) and begin spec lock decisions
3) Add docs/decisions/0002-payment-checks-spec-lock.md once decisions are locked
4) Move into contracts toolchain selection and package initialization (Foundry vs Hardhat)

## 6) Payment Checks spec lock checklist (to do next session)
- Recipient model: direct address only vs claim link
- Expiration: none vs optional timestamp
- Cancellation: allowed vs disallowed, who can cancel
- Redemption rules: partial vs full only
- Fee model: none for testnet vs placeholder
- Required events and parameters
- Deterministic status mapping used by Indexer and Explorer

## 7) Constraints
- Security first
- No secrets in repo
- Keep scope tight for testnet
- Avoid refactoring unrelated areas
- Avoid em dashes in docs

## 8) Open questions
- Target testnet network
- Supported token list for testnet
- Upgradeability approach for testnet (if any)
- Indexing approach for testnet (simple event scan vs Graph later)

## Closeout (fill after session)
- Outcome summary:
- Decisions made today:
- Files touched:
- Next steps (ordered):
