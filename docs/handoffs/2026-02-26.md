# Checks Handoff — 2026-02-26

## 1) Overview

Today we made a strategic reset decision for the Explorer UI.

Rather than continue adjusting multiple broken or partially formatted serial pages, we reduced the curated tracking list to a single showcase check:

**FMV-8427BC-UK45**

This allows us to perfect formatting, structure, and data presentation on one stable reference page before minting additional test checks.

No on-chain assets were affected. This change only impacts curated Explorer tracking and UI rendering.

---

## 2) Explorer Cleanup Decision

We removed all other test serials from:

- `data/testnet-serials.json`
- Curated homepage listings
- Local baked PNG assets (except FMV)

The Explorer is now operating in curated mode with one active reference serial.

Rationale:
- Other checks had lost contract references.
- Formatting inconsistencies were multiplying across pages.
- Continuing to patch multiple unstable pages was slowing iteration.

New workflow:
1. Perfect FMV layout.
2. Mint new test check.
3. Add it to curated list.
4. Inspect page.
5. Iterate.
6. Repeat.

## 3) Serial Page Improvements (FMV)

### UI Stabilization
- Restored consistent rounded "window" panels.
- Standardized pill buttons.
- Prevented contract + hash wrapping via horizontal scroll.
- Moved copy buttons under values.
- Improved spacing in Details panel.
- Reduced visual weight of serial title.
- Kept consistent Kanit-based styling.

### Post-Dated Formatting Improvements
Reformatted the section into structured rows:

- Post-dated until → timestamp
- Claim countdown → live countdown text
- Status → voided / claimable explanation

No stacking text blocks.
Clear left label / right value formatting.

---

## 4) Image + QR Status

- Check image rendering confirmed stable.
- All non-showcase baked images removed.
- QR overlay adjusted for improved positioning and edge sharpness.
- QR size slightly reduced for better proportional balance.

Image API remains stable.
No further image endpoint restructuring required at this stage.

---

## 5) Known Issues (Now Resolved)

Previously encountered:
- Check image failing to load.
- Contract hash wrapping.
- Red tx links due to malformed hashes.
- Button layout shifting.
- Duplicate serial routing confusion.
- QR overlay misalignment.
- Broken post-dated formatting stacking.

All are currently resolved for FMV.

---

## 6) Remaining Explorer Tasks

- Final micro-adjustments to QR placement (minor).
- Slight width tuning of right-side panels.
- Confirm consistency across desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Confirm OpenGraph preview remains correct.

---

## 7) Contracts / Checks Repo

No changes made to core smart contracts today.

Explorer work only.

---

## 8) Strategy Moving Forward

We will now:

1. Lock FMV as canonical format reference.
2. Mint one new test check.
3. Add it to curated list.
4. Verify formatting consistency.
5. Adjust only if necessary.
6. Repeat controlled expansion.

No more bulk serial additions until formatting standard is locked.

---

## 9) Architectural Clarifications

Explorer contains two serial routes:

- `pages/[serial].tsx` → redirect only
- `pages/testnet/[serial].tsx` → actual page logic

Image endpoint:
- `pages/api/checks/image/[serial].tsx`

Curated list:
- `data/testnet-serials.json`

All now confirmed understood and controlled.

---

## 10) Closeout

Today was about stabilizing.

We reduced complexity instead of increasing it.

The Explorer is now clean, controlled, and ready for precise iteration.

Next session:
- Final QR micro-adjustment.
- Confirm FMV layout is pixel-perfect.
- Begin minting next controlled test check.
