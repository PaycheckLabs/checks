# 0002 Testnet first

Date: 2026-02-12

## Decision
We will ship a public testnet beta before any mainnet launch.

## Reason
Validate end to end behavior (contracts, events, explorer logic, UX) with low cost and low risk.

## Implications
- Formal paid audit is deferred until mainnet readiness.
- Testnet still requires a security baseline: tests, static analysis, and focused review on critical paths.
