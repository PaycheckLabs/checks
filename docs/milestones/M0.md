# Milestone M0: Repo Stabilization and First Amoy Smoke Run

Status: Complete

## Summary
M0 was focused on stabilizing the repo, locking the PaymentChecks v1 spec, and proving an end to end Payment Check flow on Polygon Amoy. CI is stable and the team can deploy and run a basic on-chain smoke.

## Scope
- Stabilize CI and developer workflow
- Lock PaymentChecks v1 spec
- Deploy PaymentChecks and a mock ERC20 to Polygon Amoy
- Mint a funded check and redeem it on-chain

## Deliverables
- PaymentChecks v1 spec locked
- Core contracts implemented (PaymentChecks and IPaymentChecks)
- Foundry tests added and passing
- Amoy deployment scripts added
- CI stable with forge-std installed before build and tests
- Old backup branches removed, main is the only long-lived branch
- Feature branches used with squash merge
